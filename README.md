## 🎯 Overview

This repository is a complete learning module for understanding and implementing the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. Through a series of progressively advanced Jupyter notebooks, you'll transition from understanding the fundamental concepts of distance metrics to implementing KNN from scratch and applying it to real-world text classification problems.

The module is designed for learners in the **IIIT Summer Training Program (STP)** and provides a structured pathway to mastering one of machine learning's most intuitive yet powerful algorithms.
